Sexy Numerics
===========

This plugin allows you to accept commas, currency symbols, and percent
symbols from users for integer and float fields in an ActiveRecord model.

(This is a fork of Doug Ramsay's CommaParser, which I think is an elegant
solution for commas, so I mod'd his code instead of writing it from 
scratch.  Most of the work on this, so far, is his.
http://github.com/dramsay/comma_parser/tree/master).


Example
=======

create_table :cities do |t|
  t.string  :name,          :limit => 20,                    :null => false
  t.integer :population,                      :default => 0, :null => true
  t.float   :annual_budget, :annual_expenses, :default => 0, :null => true
  t.float   :percent_unemployed,              :default => 0, :null => true
end

class City < ActiveRecord::Base
  allow_commas            :population
  allow_currency_symbols  :annual_budget, :annual_expenses
  allow_percent_symbols   :percent_unemployed

  # rest of class
end

Now the user can type population "1,000,000" into a form and it will still 
save correctly as "1000000" instead of "1". This saves you the hassle of 
stripping out commas either in JavaScript or in the controller.


Install
=======

ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/twerth/sexy_numerics.git


Future
=======

My intention is to add other numeric Model based features, not just
character removal.
